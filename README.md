# Health Recorder: Health Record Management System Using Blockchain Technology

## üßæ Introduction

**Health Recorder** is a decentralized **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** management system using **Blockchain** technology. This system securely stores and manages health records by leveraging the benefits of **blockchain** for tamper-proof data verification and **IPFS** for decentralized storage. The system also provides granular access control to ensure secure sharing of records between patients, doctors, and other healthcare providers.
